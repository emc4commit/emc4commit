  Background:
    Given a "github" project named "seldon/seldons-project" exists
    And   a developer named "yugo" exists with a emercoin address
    And   a developer named "gaal" exists without a emercoin address
    And   our fee is "0"
    And   a deposit of "500" is made
    And   the most recent commit is "AAA"
    And   a new commit "BBB" is made with parent "AAA"
    And   a new commit "CCC" is made with parent "BBB"
    And   the author of commit "BBB" is "yugo"
    And   the author of commit "CCC" is "gaal"
    When  the project syncs with the remote repo
    Then  there should be a tip of "5" for commit "BBB"
    And   there should be a tip of "4.95" for commit "CCC"
    Given I'm not signed in
